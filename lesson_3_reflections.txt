When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I'd push my work to a remote repository when I'm sure that I have a stable
    working version of the project which I could go back to any time I want.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I might be doing something experimental in my local repository that is a
    variation of what is in my remote repository. If Git automatically pulls
    changes to my local repository, it may cause code conflicts, or worse, may
    override my local changes.
